## Social organizations need to allocate scarce resources for maximum impact

---

- predicting where services _will_ be needed
- prioritizing resources based on expected impact
- forecasting trends and changes
- identifying supporters likely to donate

### Social organizations often don’t have

## Analyzing poverty through satellite imagery

![fit right](assets/GiveDirectly_uniquePage-550x312.jpg)

[DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/) helped [GiveDirectly](https://www.givedirectly.org/) – an NGO making unconditional cash transfers to poor households via mobile phones in Kenia and Uganda[^1] – to identify especially needy villages through satellite image analysis[^2].

## Early warning system for human rights abuses

To help prioritize the many calls for help reaching Amnesty International’s Urgent Action Network DataKind volunteers have created a predictive model that analyzes messages for potential escalation.[^3][^4]

## Predicting demand for children’s hospices

![left](assets/ssc-map.jpg)

Combining data from [Shooting Star Chase](http://www.shootingstarchase.org.uk/), public data about the hospice and healthcare sector and demographic data DataKind volunteers calculated predicted demand against hospice capacity to reveal areas of possible shortage.[^5]

^ + a few other things

---

Most of DataKinds projects have been tackled by volunteers on 2-day data dives.

---

## What’s a
# [fit] Data Dive?

^ Who has been on a data dive?

---

# Before: Preparation of the data
#### (by voluntary data ambassadors in collaboration with the challenge partner – starting ~2 month before the data dive)
- anonymization/pseudonymization
- cleaning/fixing
- ensuring proper (machine readable) data formats

---

## Before:
# Preparation of the questions

---

> Any data scientist worth their salary will tell you that you should start with a question, NOT the data.
-- Jake Porway in [https://hbr.org/2013/03/you-cant-just-hack-your-way-to/](https://hbr.org/2013/03/you-cant-just-hack-your-way-to/)

---

# The Data Dive

- Challenge partners pitch their problems
- Volunteers create analyses, models and visualizations (led by data ambassadors) in two intense days of hacking
- solutions are being presented at the end

^ Big community event
^ Data Ambassadors important

---

## Aftermath:
# Implementation

#### Social organizations still don’t have the expertise: data ambassadors must help implement the solutions

^ Not yet quite clear to me
^ Sent DataKind and email to clarify

---

## Aftermath:
# Impact Analysis

#### Did it help at all?

^ Not yet quite clear to me

There is currently no organization in Germany comparable to DataKind.
