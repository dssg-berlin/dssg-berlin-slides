# Data are the new oil. NPOs run on coal.

Data science and predictive analytics are causing a lot of innovation in the private sector. Nonprofits lack technological progress. We want to close that gap and set the stage for data scientists to contribute their expertise.

Our vision is an impact oriented and data informed society.

# Data Dive as pinnacle of projects

At a weekend event the data science community partners up with our selected NPOs to solve their data problems collaboratively.

The event creates attention among data scientists and social organizations alike and enables wide participation.

It’s free for data scientists.

[Streetfootballworld](http://www.streetfootballworld.org/) is an international umbrella organization for nonprofits in the field of social change through football.

With [http://www.unleashfootball.com](http://www.unleashfootball.com) they want to collect more than 100.000 ideas on the question _„How can we make the greatest game a greater source for good?“_.

__DSSG will help to gain insights from these thousands of answers (e.g. through NLP and topic models).__

To be able to harvest the positive impact, we need partners that carry the cost of the Data Dives. Costs include the venue, equipment and catering for the data scientists.
